# What to avoid?

import videoSrc from "./assets/The Simpsons - S04E21 - Marge In Chains - Part 6 1m42.9s - 1m55.9s (vm8g7gppcbc) 3601.mp4";

<video controls preload="auto">
  <source src={videoSrc} type="video/mp4" />
</video>

# What to do?

> When it gets to be too much to take, <br />
> figure out how to factor blocks out into pure functions.

# What to do?
